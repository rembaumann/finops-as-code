## What Is FinOps as Code?

This repository contains tutorials and demos for implementing _FinOps as Code_ in your organization. 

FinOps as Code is the integration of financial operations (FinOps) principles with modern cloud-native practices. FinOps as Code promotes managing cloud costs and optimizing spend in a programmatic and automated manner. 

Like its close cousin, infrastructure-as-code (IaC), FinOps as Code supports automation scripts and cloud-native technologies so that organizations can implement FinOps practices directly into their software development lifecycle.
